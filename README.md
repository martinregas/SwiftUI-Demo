# SwiftUI-demo

SwiftUI-demo for iPhone is a project that shows iconic quotes from The Simpsons, developed in order to test my knowledge in SwiftUI.

### API 

The app obtains the quotes array from http://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/ developed by Jason Luboff.

### Third party library

The project uses the library "SwiftUI CachedAsyncImage" to store in memory the images that the API provides.
